# Python-Project

1. Partners: Kate Thompson and Charlotte Sladek
2. Research Question: How does parental income and educational attainment impact student educational achievement (as measured by SAT scores, ACT scores, high school GPA, college GPA, and years to graduate college), and how can we create a model to predict a school's educational metrics based on its income-to-poverty ratio (IPR)?
3. Coding work that has been completed: We have analyzed correlation within the educational data set (Kaggle data set with data on individual students). We have also developed several simple linear regression models using scikit-learn to predict educational metrics based on a school's IPR. We also made a multiple linear regression model that takes user input and displays the predicted college GPA and predicted years to graduate college based on that input.
4. Future coding work: We plan to refine our models, as some of them are outputting unrealistic values (such as an ACT score of 45). We also plan to analyze our inital data set (from Kaggle) more and formalize our assumptions as well as examine bias within the datasets (we know there is bias in the Kaggle data, our training data for the models, because the models are predicting unreasonably high values).
5. So far, we are able to see that higher parental income positively impacts students' educational achievement, on average.
