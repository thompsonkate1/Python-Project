# Python-Project

1. Partners: Kate Thompson and Charlotte Sladek
2. Research Question: How does family income impact student educational level (as measured by SAT scores, ACT scores, and college GPA), and how can we create a model to predict a school's educational metrics based on its income-to-poverty ratio (IPR)?
3. Coding work that has been completed: We have analyzed correlation within the educational data set. We have also begun to develop models to predict educational metrics based on a school's IPR.
4. Future coding work: We plan to refine our models. We also plan to analyze our data more and formalize our assumptions as well as examine bias within the datasets.
5. So far, to some extent, we can see that family income influences their students' educational success.
